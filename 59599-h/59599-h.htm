<p class="p0"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE PRINCIPAL PURPOSE of this bulletin is to supply plans
A for low-cost farm dwellings designed to meet the requirements
of the farm operator and his family. Some of the plans may be
useful in eases where, in addition to the main dwelling, smaller
homes are needed for relatives, tenants, or unmarried farm hands.
Still others will be found useful in the construction of low-cost houses
for temporary use.</p>

<p>A well-built farmhouse should last for 60 years or more. In the
ordinary course of events at least two generations of children will
be brought up in it. During these years the family operating the
farm probably will have no other choice of dwelling. The builder
should, therefore, think both of present needs and possible future
requirements when selecting a plan for a new farmhouse.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="FARMHOUSE_REQUIREMENTS" id="FARMHOUSE_REQUIREMENTS">FARMHOUSE REQUIREMENTS</a></h2>


<h3><a id="SIZE"></a>SIZE</h3>

<p>The first requirement of a satisfactory farmhouse is adequate size
to provide needed working area, storage space, and living and sleeping
quarters. For the average family at least three sleeping rooms
are needed,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> one for the parents, one for the boys, and one for
the girls.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Sometimes the living room must serve as one of the sleeping rooms.</p></div>

<p>All the space may not be needed at the time the house is built,
but the chances are that it will be needed before many years. On
the other hand, many families find that after the children have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
grown up and left home it is not necessary to use the entire house.
For this reason it is desirable to have it arranged so that part of
the rooms may be closed off or may be rented to tourists.</p>


<h3><a id="COMFORT_AND_CONVENIENCE"></a>COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE</h3>

<p>Adequate, well-used space for both the family and the furniture
is a large factor in farmhouse comfort. The proper number, size,
and placement of windows, doors, and stairs, and good construction
are important. These matters have been carefully worked out in the
plans shown in this bulletin. Comfort also depends to a large extent
on good heating, plumbing, lighting, and screening. Information
on some of these subjects is given in Farmers' Bulletin 1698, Heating
the Farm Home; 1448, Farmstead Water Supply; 1426, Farm
Plumbing; 1227, Sewage and Sewerage of Farm Homes; Department
Circular 405, The Domestic Oil Burner; and in U.S. Department of
Commerce bulletin, Insulation on the Farm, price 10 cents.</p>

<p>The convenient arrangement of the farmhouse begins with its relationship
to the other farm buildings and to the highway. Unlike
the city house, the farmhouse has its main line of communication
through the back or side door. Therefore outside doors and porches
should be located so as to give convenient entrance from the farm
driveway and the path to the barn, and wherever possible should be
on the sheltered side of the house.</p>

<p>If possible, there should be a convenient place near the rear entrance
for men to leave their outer wraps and to wash before going
into the house. These facilities are often provided in a washroom
or in one corner of the workroom, but if there is no washroom or
workroom in the house, there should at least be clothes hooks and a
bench and washbasin for summer use on the back porch.</p>

<p>It is also desirable that the work portions of the house, where the
housewife spends much of her time, look out over the farm buildings
and the entrance roadway. Most farm women like also a glimpse of
the highway from the kitchen window.</p>

<p>Preferably the traffic way from the rear entrance to the main portion
of the house should not lead through the kitchen. If the kitchen
must be used as a passageway, the doors should be so arranged that
the traffic does not cross the work area. This not only decreases the
possibility of interference with household activities but also makes
possible a more compact and convenient arrangement of work equipment.
An important factor is a workroom or porch, on about the
same level as the kitchen, for laundry, canning, care of milk, and
other farm activities and for supplementary food storage. This
saves much clutter in the kitchen itself and contributes to more
efficient arrangement.</p>

<p>At least one bedroom should be provided on the first-floor of the
farmhouse, not too far from the kitchen, so that small children or
sick persons may be cared for conveniently. The bathroom should be
convenient to both downstairs and upstairs bedrooms, but preferably
on the first-floor. A space for a bathroom is very desirable even if
the fixtures cannot be put in at once.</p>

<p>Ample storage space should be provided for clothing, bedding and
linen, wraps, food, dishes and utensils, cleaning equipment, toys, and
fuel. In general, these needs have been met in the plans given in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
bulletin by closets in halls and bedrooms, kitchen cabinets, shelves
or pantries, and cellar storage. Closet, cabinet, and shelf space adds
greatly to the convenience and comfort of a house and should not
be omitted.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Plans for closets and storage spaces can be obtained from the Bureau of Home
Economics.</p></div>

<p>In the smaller plans shown here, an alcove or an end of the
kitchen is indicated for use as a dining area. In the larger plans,
either a dining room or a space for dining in the living room is provided,
and in most cases there is also space in the kitchen for
"hurry-up" meals.</p>

<p>The following points have been kept in mind in planning the
kitchens.</p>

<p>A sink in every house is recommended. Even when water must be
carried into the house, the sink and drain add much to the convenience
of the kitchen and may be installed very cheaply. Where running
water is not available, a pump may be installed beside the sink.
However, running water, hot and cold, adds more to the convenience
of the farm-home than almost any other factor.</p>

<p>The sink should be well-lighted, with windows over or at one end
of it. Windows over the sink should have the sills higher than the
back of the sink. Such windows will need to be shielded from sun
glare unless on the north side of the house. The sink should have a
drain board at the left end, at the right a flat shelf for stacking
dishes if there is no drain board there. Dish storage should be
near enough the left end of the sink for the dishes to be put away
without unnecessary steps.</p>

<p>The cookstove should be conveniently near the sink, preferably
against the side wall, or across from it if the kitchen is narrow.</p>

<p>A small food-preparation surface, table or shelf, should be placed
next to the stove at the same height as the cooking surface. There
should be cupboard space near the stove for the storage of cooking
utensils. A worktable should be provided for long mixing jobs;
it should have knee space and toe space. Staple supplies should be
stored near this table and, if possible, should be near the refrigerator
and not too far from the stove.</p>

<p>The refrigerator should, for convenient use, be as near as possible
to the worktable and stove; however, the higher the surrounding
temperature the greater the cost of operating the refrigerator. If
an ice refrigerator is used, a location near the outside door lessens
the tracking of dirt into the house. A ventilated cupboard near the
worktable is convenient for storing the less perishable foods and
reduces the season during which ice is needed.</p>


<h3><a id="RELATION"></a>RELATION TO OTHER BUILDINGS AND HIGHWAY</h3>

<p>A house designed for the south or west side of the highway should
be reversed if it is to be built on the north or east. For example,
plan 6521 (<a href="#Page_23">p. 23</a>) would fit nicely on either the south or the west
side of the main road. If it were south of the highway, with the
drive as shown, the kitchen would be on the east where it would have
the advantage of the morning sunlight and in most localities the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
screened porch would be sheltered from the coldest winds. If the
house were on the west side of the road, the kitchen would still get
morning sunlight, and the porch would protect it from the afternoon
sun. On the other hand, if the house were to be built on the north
or east side of the road, the kitchen would be badly sheltered and
lighted, but reversing the plan so that the kitchen would be on the
right instead of the left side of the house would remedy these
conditions.</p>

<p>Before deciding to build any house the plan should be studied
carefully to see how it will best fit the location and the arrangement
of the rest of the farmstead.</p>


<h3><a id="APPEARANCE"></a>APPEARANCE</h3>

<p>Attractive appearance of a farmhouse is to be obtained by:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Good taste in its proportions and exterior design.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Materials chosen to suit the local environment and type of house, effectively
employed.</p>

<p class="blockquot">A pleasing color scheme for the house, in harmony with its surroundings.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Proper planning with relation to the natural features of the site, the other
farm buildings, and the highway.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Grading the site and planting trees, shrubs, and flowers.</p>

<p>If the homes shown in this bulletin are carefully built according
to the drawings, they will be satisfactory with respect to the first two
points.</p>

<p>Proper location of the house is exceedingly important and must be
worked out on the ground. Farmers' Bulletin 1132, Planning the
Farmstead, and 1087. Beautifying the Farmstead, will be found helpful
in this and in the planting of trees and shrubs around the house.
Farmers' Bulletin 1452, Painting on the Farm, discusses kinds and
uses of paints. Other bulletins on these subjects are available from
several of the State agricultural colleges.</p>


<h3><a id="SAFETY"></a>SAFETY</h3>

<p>Safety in the farmhouse depends first on good construction for
protection from damage by wind, fire, decay, and termites. Safety
is promoted also by planning to avoid hazards from low beams, steep
or unguarded stairways, or badly placed doors and windows. The
working drawings for the houses illustrated herein embody good
practice in these matters. The welfare and convenience of the occupants
will be further permanently safeguarded through rat-proof
construction, which eliminates "rat harbors", and denies easy entrance
of the rodents to the building. Additional safety may be
secured at slight cost by following the recommendations in Farmers'
Bulletins 1590, Fire Protective Construction on the Farm; 1638, Rat
Proofing Buildings and Premises; and 1649, Construction of Chimneys
and Fireplaces; Leaflet 87, Wind-Resistant Construction for
Farm Buildings, and Leaflet 101, Injury to Buildings by Termites.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CONSTRUCTION_MATERIALS" id="CONSTRUCTION_MATERIALS">CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</a></h2>


<p>The houses shown in this bulletin may, with slight changes, be
built of wood, stone, concrete, brick, tile, earth, steel, or other materials.
The choice depends largely on owner's preference, local availability
and price, and the skill of local builders in using one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span>
another. Many new materials for various purposes such as roofing,
flooring, and insulation are on the market and deserve consideration.</p>

<p>The practice common among farmers of hauling their own stone or
concrete materials, cutting their own logs where possible, having
their lumber sawed at local mills, and doing part of the actual construction
work, aid in reducing the cash outlay and in making possible
a better house for the same money expenditure. This is especially
true where lumber is sawed long enough before building starts
to allow thorough seasoning. This seasoning of lumber is important
and is too often disregarded.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="COSTS" id="COSTS">COSTS</a></h2>


<p>The most satisfactory way to learn the probable cost of a house is
to obtain estimates from one or more local builders. Approximate
costs may, of course, be obtained by comparing the proposed house
with one built recently in the same community, or rough estimates
may be based on the size of the house and typical unit costs for the
locality.</p>

<p>Unit costs based on prices and wages prevailing in the spring of
1934 for houses suitable for the localities were obtained for about
300 counties by the Farm Housing Survey, A summary of the
figures is as follows:</p>


<h3><a id="CELLARS"></a>CELLARS</h3>

<p>Costs for ordinary cellars were reported for most sections as varying
from 50 cents to $1 per square foot of floor space. The cost per
square foot is, of course, less for a large than for a small cellar, other
things being equal. Easy excavation and low-cost materials also
make for low unit cost. Costs of nearly $2 per square foot were
reported in some sections where the ground-water level is high and
cellar walls and floor must be carefully waterproofed. In sections
where cellars are not ordinarily used the cost of the foundation was
reported as part of the cost of the house superstructure.</p>


<h3><a id="SUPERSTRUCTURES"></a>SUPERSTRUCTURES AND PORCHES</h3>

<p>Reported costs of one-story frame superstructures, including heating,
plumbing, and lighting equipment ordinarily used in the locality,
ranged from $1.25 to $2.25 per square foot of floor space in the
South, from $2.25 to $3.50 in the West and Southwest, from $2.50
to $4 in the North, and from $3 to $4.50 in New England. Costs in
Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia and in a narrow belt along
the east coast, including Florida, were reported from $2 to $3.25, and
in the timber-producing sections of the Northwest at about $2 per
square foot. Costs in any locality are influenced by local factors,
generally being relatively high near cities and in thickly settled
sections and relatively low in places where there are local supplies
of lumber or other materials.</p>

<p>Differences in cost between the various sections are due to differences
in the kinds of houses built, as well as to differences in material
costs and wages. The typical house in the North is much more compact
and substantial and provided with more expensive heating
equipment than the typical house in the South.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span></p>

<p>The cost per square foot of floor area of two-story frame houses
was reported as being 5 to 15 percent less than that of one-story
houses in the same locality.</p>

<p>The costs of typical masonry superstructures were generally reported
at $2 to $3 per square foot of floor area in the southern third
of the United States, from $3 to $4 per square foot in the central
third, and more than $4 per square foot in the northern third of the
country. There were many variations from these general levels,
however, costs of about $2 per square foot being reported in many
localities in the States bordering on or south of the Ohio River.
Costs reported for counties along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts were
generally higher than for those in the interior. Little difference in
cost per square foot of floor area in one-story and in two-story
masonry houses was reported. The higher costs reported for
masonry houses as compared with frame are probably due in part
to better grades of finish and equipment used in the masonry houses.</p>

<p>The costs per square foot of floor space of open porches were reported
as being about half the costs per square foot of floor space in
one-story houses of similar materials.</p>


<h3><a id="ESTIMATING"></a>ESTIMATING BY UNIT COSTS</h3>

<p>The floor areas of the cellar, the porches, and the house itself (the
superstructure) are shown with each plan. They do not include
unexcavated cellar space nor unfinished space in attics. The areas
were figured from the working drawings (see <a href="#Page_7">p. 7</a>) because in some
cases the dimensions given in the plans herein are approximate only.
The superstructure area of a house of more than one story is
given here as the area of the first-floor plus the usable area of the
second-floor. Stairways, halls, and closets are included. To estimate
very roughly what a house might cost, multiply the number of square
feet of cellar floor space by a cost per square foot based on the costs
stated above. Do the same for the house superstructure and the
porches, and add the figures together. This, with allowance for
price changes since the spring of 1934, will give a rough estimate of
total cost of the house. The actual cost will, of course, be affected
by the materials and home equipment which the owner selects and
by the skill and efficiency of the builders.</p>

<p>If the owner can furnish part of the material or labor, or if interior
finish or equipment is omitted, the initial cash outlay may be reduced.
Estimates based on local prices and wage rates are to be preferred to
those based on the cost figures given above.</p>

<p>Little study has been given to what amounts farm people are justified
in spending for their houses, but several investigations have
been made of expenditures for housing by people with fixed incomes.
It is generally agreed that the house ordinarily should not cost more
than two and one-half times the average annual net income of the
family. In the case of the farm family the value of the living furnished
by the farm should be considered as part of the income.
Another generally accepted rule, which perhaps is more nearly applicable
to farm conditions, is that not more than 25 percent&mdash;usually
not more than 20 percent&mdash;of the average annual net income of the
family should be required for housing, including principal payments,
interest, taxes, insurance, repairs, and miscellaneous costs.</p>

<h2><a name="WORKING_DRAWINGS" id="WORKING_DRAWINGS">WORKING DRAWINGS</a></h2>


<p>Working drawings have been prepared giving all necessary dimensions
and details for building these homes. Farmers may obtain
copies of these drawings from the agricultural extension services of
the State agricultural colleges. The State extension services will
supply only those plans which are suitable in their respective States,
and usually will make a small charge to cover printing and mailing.</p>


<h3><a id="CAUTION"></a>CAUTION REGARDING CHANGES</h3>

<p>These plans have been carefully prepared by competent architects
in consultation with home-management specialists and agricultural
engineers familiar with farm conditions in all parts of the United
States. It is urged that the plans be studied carefully before making
a selection, but that no changes be made in them except for alternate
arrangements indicated by the drawings or descriptions. Changing
the size of a room or the location of a door or window may spoil
some other valuable feature, and is almost certain to harm the appearance
of the house. Doors and windows should be selected according
to the descriptive material on the drawings. Sizes should
be closely adhered to for best appearance.</p>

<p>The prospective builder should not try to obtain too much originality,
but rather should base his selection on those features of the
plan which will give the utmost satisfaction in the long run. Differences
in slope of ground, location of the drive and farm buildings,
and position and amount of trees and shrubbery, all will contribute to
the distinctive appearance of the home.</p>

<p>For homes of the type offered in this bulletin, the surroundings
should be kept free from distracting adornments. As a general rule,
a few trees to provide shade, some flowering shrubs of native growth
grouped close to the building to break harsh lines, and a bed or two
of flowers selected for their color value, will be sufficient decorative
relief.</p>

<h2><a name="PLANS_FOR_HOUSES" id="PLANS_FOR_HOUSES">PLANS FOR HOUSES</a></h2>


<p>The 40 house plans shown in this bulletin have been arranged in
four groups representing, respectively, (1) 1-story growing houses;
(2) 1-story houses originally built with two or more separate bedrooms;
(3) houses of 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> or 2 stories; and (4) very small houses.
Some of the plans might have been placed in another group about
as well as in that in which they are shown.</p>


<h3><a id="ONE-STORY"></a>ONE-STORY GROWING HOUSES</h3>

<p>There are many arguments in favor of the growing house for the
farm. The first unit can be erected at a moderate cost, yet the finished
house may have all the features considered important. As more
space is needed the owner often can build the additions himself,
taking advantage of slack times to cut lumber from his own land,
haul sand and gravel for concrete, and in other ways reduce the cost
of the additions. The chief difficulty with the growing house is that
it is likely to grow very slowly. By the time additions are made
the house is considered old by its occupants, and the additions are
likely not to receive as careful attention as the original house.</p>

<img src="images/page8_house.png" width="326" height="217" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The growing houses in this bulletin have been carefully planned
so that both the first units and the final structure are satisfactory in
usefulness and in appearance. The additions fit into the original
units with a minimum of ripping out and rearrangement.</p>


<h3>PLAN 6511,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTHWEST</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 605 square feet; with 1-bedroom
addition 815 square feet; with 2-bedroom addition 960 square feet.</div>

<p>This plan is for a permanent dwelling of frame, stucco, stone,
adobe, or other
construction. If
desired, the first
unit may be built
without bedrooms,
as shown, and the
living room used
for sleeping quarters
until the
house is completed.
The two
large closets of
this living room
add much to its
value, and the arrangement
with all doors at one end of the
room permits efficient use of
the space.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 238px;">
<img src="images/page8_plan.png" width="238" height="357" alt="" />
</div>

<p>If the first unit is to be used
for several years before the
bedrooms are added, the small
bathroom with shower will be
especially desirable. That
space must be used for other
purposes, however, and the
bathroom fixtures moved when
one or both bedrooms are
added.</p>

<p>An alternate kitchen arrangement
suggested by the
Bureau of Home Economics
for houses in which only an
oil, gas, or electric stove is
needed and meals will usually
be eaten in the living-dining
room is shown on <a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6512,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTH</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 715 square feet; second stage with
one bedroom 1,085 square feet; third stage 1,515 square feet. Porch, 250 square
feet.</div>

<div class="fig_left" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/page10_house.png" width="256" height="201" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Plan 6512 is designed for southern conditions, to afford ample
shade from a glaring summer sun. The arrangement of rooms permits
the building to face toward the south, thus taking advantage
of the summer breezes from
that direction. The glazed
porch on the north side offers
a cool spot for summer meals,
while the meals served during
cold weather would naturally
be more enjoyable in
front of a blazing fire at the
west end of the living room.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/page10_plan1.png" width="210" height="220" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The second stage of the
house adds the center bedroom
of the three shown in
the third stage. The partitions
for the hall and the closets near
the south porch are not needed
until the third stage. If at all
possible, the center bedroom
should be built with the original
unit to provide more sleeping
space; but if it is necessary to
watch the budget closely, the
large living room or the glazed
porch can be pressed into temporary
service as sleeping quarters.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6513,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTH</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, first unit 490 square feet; with first addition
705 square feet; completed house 1,015 square feet. Porches, first unit 25
square feet; with first addition 240 square feet.</div>

<p>The first unit of house 6513 is modest, and yet provides complete
kitchen equipment, toilet facilities, a workroom or laundry, and g
bedroom of comfortable size. The first addition increases the living
accommodations and, with its front and rear porches, offers a cool
retreat in hot weather. The second addition provides two more bedrooms
and an adjoining bath, thus completing the six-room house.
If desired, these two bedrooms may be made larger than shown in
the plans.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/page12_kitchen.png" width="439" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The interior view shows the compact arrangement of kitchen cabinets
and sink, and indicates the bright work area that is planned to
lighten the duties of the housewife. An alternate arrangement of
the kitchen, with no workroom, is shown on <a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a>.</p>

<p>During the first two stages of development adequate space will be
found in the kitchen for dining; but when two bedrooms are added
in the final wing, the original bedroom (adjoining the kitchen) might
be converted into a dining room. On the other hand, if at times the
entire house is not needed by the family, the last wing of the house
will make very desirable rooms for renting to tourists or summer
boarders, or may be closed.</p>

<p>In some parts of the South the fireplace will not provide sufficient
heat in cold weather, but a circulator heater may be set in front of
the fireplace and connected to the chimney through a metal shield.
If the plan is used in the North, a cellar may be constructed under
the second unit, with stairs leading down from the rear porch, which
should be enclosed.</p>

<p>House 6514, with basement and furnace, is well adapted to northern
or mid-western conditions. The steps to the basement may be outside
the building as shown, or the washroom may be extended so as
to include the steps and provide greater protection during stormy
weather.</p>

<p>The original house, in order to come in the class of low-cost houses,
does not contain a bath. A pump at the kitchen sink provides water
until funds permit of the installation of a modern plumbing system.</p>

<p>The first unit of the house may be heated either by a circulator
heater in the living room or by a furnace. The furnace will be
especially desirable after the second unit is added.</p>

<p>The added bedroom wing is recessed from the main building line
to permit cross ventilation through the bedroom in the original house.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6516,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTH</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, original unit 685 square feet; with first addition
1,035 square feet; completed house 1,345 square feet. Porches, original 90
square feet; completed house 155 square feet.</div>

<p>The original unit of house 6516 is a two-room structure of ample
size. The dining room and kitchen are combined in one room, while
the other room is temporarily both bedroom and living room. A
porch leading directly into the kitchen affords entrance during the
initial stage. In the center of the first unit are an unusually large
storage closet and a chimney reminiscent of colonial Virginia. In
localities where firewood is not readily available the fireplace may be
omitted and a stove used for heating the bedroom.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/page16_plan.png" width="448" height="350" alt="PLAN SHOWING FUTURE ADDITIONS" />
</div>

<p>Additions to the house are indicated on both sides of the original;
the first addition undoubtedly would be that with the bedroom and
bath. The rear porch can be enclosed if needed, and will then serve
for laundering and other work that is more convenient not to do in
the kitchen. The second addition will complete the house with a
living room and front porch.</p>

<p>The addition of the living room and front porch requires considerable
change in the arrangement of the kitchen to keep traffic from
the back door to the living room from passing directly in front of
the range. It will be best to set the range against the end wall, and
preferably to use an electric or oil range so that no new chimney will
be required. After the living room is added, less dining space will
be needed in the kitchen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 660 square feet; completed house
1,025 square feet. Porches, 300 square feet.</div>

<p>In plan 6517 a large amount of space is provided at low-cost by
using the cheapest type of construction and omitting the interior finish
at the time of building, for when a large family must be housed
and funds are limited space is often more desirable than good finish
and ease of heating. The exterior walls are of vertical boards and
battens, and the roof is of galvanized corrugated metal. The house
may be improved at any time by lining the walls and ceiling. The
kitchen arrangement shows a treatment recommended by home economists,
the sink and worktable at right angles to the wall, with
shelves above them. This scheme has the advantage of separating
the working and dining areas, yet it does not hamper easy communication
between the rooms at meal hours. If desired, a bed may be
placed in the living room, yet the house is so arranged that each
sleeping room will have complete privacy. The side wall of the
small bedroom next to the kitchen is intended to be made of 1-inch
boards with battens on both sides.</p>

<p>The addition of bedrooms with closets and a bathroom is suggested.
This addition will provide space for a circulator heater,
which is a convenience when no cellar is planned.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 835 square feet; with addition 1,160

<p>Several novel features about this small dwelling will appeal to the
farm-home builder. A heater room on the main floor near the rear
entrance and the kitchen avoids the need for a cellar. A kitchen
like this, with three outside walls to give light and cross ventilation
and a better view of the farmstead and highway, is often desirable.
The end of the living room next the kitchen is narrowed to a dining
alcove, and when more space is needed the dining table may be extended
into the living room. The completed bungalow has three
bedrooms, with ample closet space. The rear porch will provide a
comfortable, shady place to work
outside during the warm summer
days.</p>

<p>In the first stage of construction
the two bedrooms at the rear
may be omitted. This would still
leave one bedroom and the bathroom
and temporary
closet space in
the original bungalow.
Then the two
other bedrooms can
be added later,
when funds become
available, or a
screened and glazed
sleeping porch with
outside entrance
could be built instead.
A porch off
the living room
could also be added.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6519,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTHWEST</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 775 square feet; with addition
1,075 square feet. Porches, 160 square feet.</div>

<p>The plans and perspectives on these pages show two methods of
roofing this house. In each plan the original unit of the house is
complete, and pleasing in appearance, and the additions fit the house
gracefully with very little tearing out or rearrangement.</p>

<p>As in some other plans, the kitchen is designed for the use of an
oil, gas, or electric cookstove. The house may be heated by a circulator
hot-air heater, by a hot-water system with a radiator boiler in
the living room, or possibly by radiant gas or electric heaters in the
bedrooms.</p>

<p>The type of design favors keeping the house close to the ground.
If floor-joist construction is used, the topsoil should be removed from
under the house so that joists will not come too close to the ground
surface. A concrete subfloor could be placed directly on the ground,
supporting wood sleepers and wood floors.</p>

<p>With their low-pitched roofs, and modest design both inside and
out, plans 6520 and 6521 represent very desirable types of farmhouses.
Such buildings blend with their surroundings to produce a real
homey atmosphere. Originally planned for southern conditions,
where a circulator heater placed in the hall should be adequate, these
plans are adapted to colder regions if the houses are well constructed
and are provided with basements and central heating plants as
indicated on the working drawings.</p>

<p>In both designs the development from two large rooms progresses
logically, the main difference being that in plan 6520 the additions
are made at the side,
while in plan 6521 the
new rooms are added
at the rear of the first
unit. Although all the
rooms of 6521 a r e
shown as larger than
those of 6520, by slight
alterations either size
of house may be built
from either plan. The
choice should be determined
largely by the
slope of the building
site.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/page24_plan.png" width="372" height="390" alt="" />
</div>

<p>In each original house a temporary partition provides 2 bedrooms
in place of a living room. The first addition adds 2 other bedrooms,
and the removal of the partition between the temporary bedrooms
provides a large living room. The second addition increases the
total number of bedrooms to 3 by adding 2 and refitting 1 in the
first addition as a bathroom.</p>

<p>Each kitchen is ideally located to command a view of the driveway,
highway, and farm buildings. Closets, pantry, and other equipment
utilize the darker part of the room, leaving the lighter portions
for working area and dining table. These arrangements are complete
in the original house.</p>

<p>On the screened back porch, which is equipped with laundry trays
and closet, men coming from the fields may hang their outside work
garments and, except in cold weather, wash before entering the house.
Here a great deal of the dirty and messy work in preparing fruits
and vegetables for canning may be done. Entrance from the screened
porch to the bath or bedrooms reduces to a minimum the traffic
through the kitchen and living room. In plan 6520 the screened
porch might be divided by a lattice into work and living spaces.</p>

<p>On account of its compact arrangement, this low-cost house furnishes
a very satisfactory amount of usable space for the small
family and may be enlarged to three-bedroom size, as indicated on
the plans. The kitchen is well-arranged, with moderate storage
space, and a wood box filled from outside, with a ventilated cupboard
or cooler above it. The workroom, unusually large for a small
house, is a good place for laundry or canning and for men to clean
up before coming in to meals. Dining space is provided at the
rear of the living room. This house should be compared with no.
6527 (<a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>).</p>

<p>Board and batten construction is very suitable for a low-cost house,
but any other type of construction may be used for plan 6522 if
preferred. If the house is built in a cold climate, probably it will be
desirable to omit the fireplace and heat the living and bedrooms with
a circulator heater.</p>

<p>Communication between rooms is an important consideration in
modern house planning. This has been provided in house 6523 by
a small hall, which permits access not only from one room to another
but also to the outside, the basement stairs, the washroom, the bathroom,
and the linen closet, thus eliminating the necessity of using
any room as a passageway.</p>

<p>Alternate extensions are shown, the choice probably depending
upon the surrounding ground contour. Addition <i>B</i> should receive
first consideration, because it brings the two new bedrooms into
closer relation with the bathroom and does not destroy the washroom
adjoining the rear entrance. It does, however, reduce the size
of one of the first bedrooms.</p>

<p>If addition <i>A</i> is contemplated, the window at <i>X</i> should be located
at <i>Y</i> when the first unit is built. The steps in the hall of addition
A may be omitted if the ground slopes down at the rear so that the
floor of the addition can be built at a lower level than the floor of
the original house.</p>

<p>If addition <i>B</i> is to be used, the window at <i>Z</i> should be located so
as to come in the hall of the addition.</p>

<p>The charm of house 6524 lies in its informality and simplicity.
It is built for comfort and service. The broad expanse of roof,
relieved by a gable, gives it a substantial yet homelike appearance.
This is an easy house to move around in, and the kitchen is very
nicely arranged. The screened porch, in addition to providing a
cool and inviting summer dining and work space, affords ready
access to all the rooms of the house. If the future addition of bedrooms
is contemplated, the hall window in the first unit should be
replaced with a door. This will not only provide an extra exit
from the house but obviate unnecessary cutting and tearing out when
the addition is built.</p>

<p>The cellar provides space for a central heating plant, it desired.</p>

<p>This simple farmhouse develops into a home of dignity and charm.
The original unit furnishes all modern conveniences and an ample
basement. Future bedrooms may be added as required, while the
extended living room might be built as the final touch of growing
prosperity.</p>

<p>It will be of interest to the reader to note the similarity of arrangement
of this house and no. 6519 (<a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>). These plans were developed
independently, but the coincidence emphasizes the practicability of
having the work and living areas on the side of the building next
to the driveway and the bedrooms toward the rear, with the bathroom
located as centrally as possible. The design of a small house
for farm use is greatly influenced by the rather fixed location of the
kitchen.</p>

<h3><a id="MODERATE-SIZED"></a>MODERATE-SIZED ONE-STORY HOUSES</h3>

<p>Houses of this group can best be built complete at one time, though
in several cases it is noted that rooms may be omitted from the original
building or extra rooms added. The larger houses of this group
provide about the same features as the completed growing houses.
The more compact two-bedroom houses are well adapted to farms
where two or more separate dwellings are needed.</p>


<h3>PLAN 6526,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span> FOR TIMBERED SECTIONS</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas; Superstructure, 845 square feet. Porches, 300 square feet.</div>

<p>In spite of present-day improvements in building materials, there
is something about the rugged appearance of a log cabin that harmonizes
with rural settings. Log construction blends into wooded
surroundings more intimately than boards, bricks, or stucco.</p>

<p>House 6526 will accommodate 4 persons comfortably, or even 5 or
6 persons if a couch is placed in a corner of the living room.</p>

<p>The location of the bathroom not only serves the bedrooms but is
convenient to the kitchen and the rear porch.</p>

and fireplace. The ample size of the kitchen, and its built-in cupboards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35 </a></span>
dish cabinets, and other conveniences add greatly to the
desirability of the design. If a pass cupboard between kitchen and

<p>This house is similar in many respects to the first unit of 6522
(<a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>), but is enlarged to provide for the bathroom. A shallow
root cellar with room above is added at the rear of the house to
provide extra storage if needed in localities where a cellar is not

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 800 square feet. Cellar, 800 square feet.</div>

<p>House 6528 is intended for use in cold, snowy regions, where
farmers need cellars for storing fuel and vegetables. The hip roof
helps to brace the house against the wind and is economical of material.
A well-insulated ceiling is recommended to help keep the
house comfortable. The substantial chimney in the center of the
house, with separate flues for furnace, kitchen range, and fireplace,
insures good draft and no wasted heat. The vestibule at the front
and the hall arrangement at the side door also aid in keeping the
house warm. Both doors are convenient to the driveway and the
path to the barn.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/page37_plan.png" width="319" height="199" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The washroom and laundry of this house are in the cellar. This
is a satisfactory and economical arrangement where there is good
drainage for both
the cellar and the
plumbing fixtures,
and is particularly
advantageous on
rolling ground.
But one should beware
of putting a
deep cellar in a
poorly drained location.

<h3>PLAN 6529<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 740 square feet. Porches, 250 square feet.</div>

<p>This house was designed to meet the needs of a family of 4 to 6
people. The porch faces the highway, and paths from the front and
side porches lead to the farm drive.</p>

<p>The kitchen is complete and compact. The extra space found in
many farm kitchens has been omitted and a workroom added to
provide for laundry and other rough work. This also provides a
place for men to leave their outer wraps and wash before entering
the living room. Storage space can be obtained in the attic by the
use of a disappearing stair in the workroom ceiling.</p>

<p>No wood or coal range is provided for in this plan, because the use
of an oil, gas, or electric stove saves space in the kitchen and correspondingly
reduces the cost of the house. This saving and the convenience
of a small, compact cooking unit deserve careful consideration
in localities where these fuels are cheaply available. Heating is
accomplished by means of a circulator heater in the living room.</p>

<p>The designer of this plan states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">The bedrooms are small. They are little used during waking hours, thus they
can be reduced with less injury to family comfort than any other room. The
large living room more than compensates for this.</div>

<div class="blockquot">When funds are limited it is always debatable, in a great portion of the
United States, whether spending money for a porch is wise, because the same
money could be used instead to increase the area of the house proper. In this
particular case the porch could be left off without harm.</div>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,155 square feet. Porches, 245 square feet.</div>

<p>The well-known economy of square house construction is illustrated
by this plan. A choice of heating methods without a cellar is indicated.
If a circulator heater is used in the hall, as shown, the chimney
between the bedrooms will not be needed, and if extra bedrooms
are wanted they may be added as in plan 6517 (<a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>). A fireplace in
the back bedroom would, of course, interfere with taking a hall off
this room.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 268px;">
<img src="images/page39_plan.png" width="268" height="286" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Kitchen doors are located to permit easy communication between
the screened porch and the hall without interference with the work
area while the screened porch is useful as both work and dining area.
This latter feature, together
with the ample size of the
bedrooms, living room
kitchen, makes the dwelling
especially suitable for the
small family in the South.
The addition of a cellar under
one-half of the house
and of a central heating
plant would adapt this plan
to other sections of the country,
though the rooms are
rather larger than is common
in the North.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6531<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,185 square feet. Porches, 155 square feet.</div>

<p>House 6531 should be compared with no. 6533. The two plans
were developed independently, but are very similar and illustrate a
logical grouping of rooms for a farmhouse. In some respects the
arrangement of 6531 works out more satisfactorily because it is not
restricted by the structural details of framing a pitched roof.</p>

<p>This house is a model of compactness and efficiency. Note the
simple but effective way in which the kitchen and heater room are
located back to back. The floor of the heater room is a concrete slab,
two steps below the main floor level. A pass cupboard between the
kitchen and dining room is handy for serving meals. It also provides
storage space beneath its counter. The entire bedroom side may be
omitted from the original house, in which case the workroom would
serve for dining and the dining room for a bedroom.</p>

<p>All dimensions of this house are multiples of 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet. Wall, door,
and window sections might be prefabricated so that erection would
consist merely of bolting the sections together, or the house can be
built in the ordinary way. The sketch at the top of <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a> illustrates
the use of sheet metal as an exterior covering, the one in the
center shows concrete blocks, and the bottom view shows the walls
covered with a combination of lap siding and shingles or wide boards.</p>

<p>The flat roof should be covered with good roofing and well-insulated
for comfort in both summer and winter as described in the
working drawings. The cost of the insulated flat roof should not
be greater than that of an ordinary pitched roof without insulation.
The accumulation of snow will help to keep the building warm.</p>

<p>This is a new type of low-cost house designed to provide five small
single bedrooms or sleeping compartments and one bedroom of average
size. The sleeping compartments are not very large, but to
secure privacy and yet maintain economy of construction, something
must be sacrificed. In this case it is unnecessary space.</p>

<p>The sketch showing the arrangement of bunks illustrates an interesting
feature of this house. In the right-hand room the bunk is
near the floor, and wardrobe and dresser space is obtained in the partition
between the two rooms. In the left-hand room the bunk is
4 feet above the floor and projects over the one on the other side of
the partition. Wardrobe space is arranged under the bunk. This
room is especially suitable for a boy. A folding study table is
provided under the window in each room. On warm nights air circulation
would be obtained by opening the bedroom doors to the hall,
which is ventilated by the windows above the lower roof. By
omitting all but one of the partitions forming the five small bedrooms
two good-sized rooms can be obtained.</p>

</tr>
</table>

<p>The exterior appearance may seem, at first glance, unusually
severe, but by omitting a pitched roof and the ornamental features
of cornice moldings and trim decorations, the cost of construction
is materially lowered. Here everything has been reduced to the
simplest form possible.</p>

<p>With the heater room adjoining the kitchen, there is little need
for a basement, thus an important item of expense is eliminated.
The kitchen and workroom form a compact and very convenient unit
along the driveway side of the house, while the large living room
commands a good view of the highway. The living room and halls
are lighted and ventilated by the small windows above the lower
roofs. Closet space is provided in every room.</p>

<p>As in plan 6531 (<a href="#Page_40">p. 40</a>), all dimensions are multiples of 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> feet
so that the house can be either prefabricated or built in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>House 6533 is one of the few designs in which a separate dining
space was allotted. Many people do not consider a separate dining
room essential in the small farmhouse, and additional space adds
to the cost, but in this case the arrangement adds to the spaciousness
of the interior without greatly increasing the cost.</p>

<p>The rear entry is large enough to serve as laundry and washroom,
and constitutes a back way from the kitchen to the bedrooms and
bathroom without passing through the living room.</p>

<p>The kitchen, with cross ventilation and ample cupboard and counter
space, is a pleasant workshop for the housewife, and is so
arranged that easy service to the dining alcove is possible.</p>

<p>The bedrooms and adjoining bath are grouped together, allowing
that portion of the house to be closed off from the living portion.</p>

<p>In the cellar is the heating plant, with fuel bin.</p>

<p>The house is kept low to give it an appearance of hugging the
ground, but in no case should the joists be below the ground level.
Shingles, beveled siding, or clapboards may be used for the exterior
surface.</p>

<h3><a id="HOUSES"></a>HOUSES OF MORE THAN ONE STORY</h3>

<p>In many respects houses of more than one story are better suited
for farm use in the Northern States than single-story buildings.
They are more economical in foundation and roof construction, and
are easier to heat. They should be arranged with one bedroom and
a bath, or at least a toilet, on the ground floor. A cellar for fuel and
vegetable storage and a central heating plant are usually needed with
this type of house. The laundry may also be located in the cellar
if suitable drainage and a grade door to the outside can be obtained,
but in a poorly drained location it is best to keep the laundry above-ground.
In building a cellar advantage should be taken of the slope
of the ground to obtain good lighting and an easy entrance on the
low side of the slope.</p>

<p>To avoid uncomfortably warm second-floor bedrooms in summer
cross ventilation should be provided in each room. Insulation of
the ceiling is valuable both in summer and in winter.</p>

<p>It is very convenient to have a bathroom on the second-floor as
well as one on the first-floor, especially if rooms are to be rented to
tourists when the family does not need the whole house.</p>

<p>The first-floor and cellar plans of house 6534 are almost the same as
the original unit of no. 6525 (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>), but there are comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
bedrooms, a bath, and closet space on the second-floor. If funds are
available to build the living room wing indicated, the entire dwelling
will breathe the traditional southern spirit of hospitable spaciousness.</p>

<p>The hall and stair arrangements of this house are very good. Persons
coming in at the back door can leave wraps in the vestibule at
the head of the cellar stairs and go directly to any downstairs room
or to the cellar, yet there is little lost space.</p>

<p>If the house should at some time be occupied by a small family,
the entire upstairs could be shut off. Persons wishing rooms for
tourists will find either the upstairs bedrooms or the downstairs
bedroom and bath very suitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>This might well be considered the smallest story-and-a-half farmhouse

space to good advantage, omitting a bath in the original structure
for the sake of economy. The working drawings show a future
addition to the house which provides a bedroom and bath on
the first-floor. The alternate floor plan shows a dormer in the
rear like the one on the front, to make room for a second-floor bath.</p>

<p>This design illustrates a type of farmhouse frequently built in recent
years because of its simple lines and economy of construction. It
illustrates the pleasing possibility of fitting the farmhouse to sloping

sag in years to come.
A second bathroom
may be provided in

<p>The downstairs hall, lighted by the windows on the stairs, is compact

room is well-lighted and has
good wall spaces for furniture.
The combined kitchen and dining
room, with the sink at right
angles to the outside wall, as
shown in the interior view, gives
the housewife three walls of continuous
work surfaces and in
addition light and the view
from all the windows of the
room. Children can play or
older members visit in the dining
end with slight interference
to the housewife's work. This
is especially helpful on chilly
days in the fall and spring when
the kitchen stove provides the
only heat in the house.</p>

<p>The part basement furnishes
space for a furnace and for storage
of fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>House 6538 may be roofed in a number of ways, with slight alterations
in the arrangement of the second-floor. The appearance is, of
course, greatly altered; but in each case is pleasing. With the modernistic
flat roof, any waste spaces caused by the sloping roofs in the
other designs are eliminated. The storage room on the second-floor
then becomes suitable for a child's bedroom, a sewing room, or an
office, and the flat-deck

Since the arrangement

study before deciding
upon the site
and placing of the

<h3>PLAN 6540<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 1,380 square feet. Porch, 70 square feet. Cellar,
760 square feet.</div>

<p>This plan is intended for use in the North, where the compact
floor plan with cellar and inside chimney and the front vestibule
will simplify the heating problem. The first-floor level is above
the ordinary height of packed snow in winter, but the grade entrance
gives easy communication with both the cellar and the main part of
the house. This permits convenient use of the cellar as a washroom
and laundry, if in a well-drained location, as well as for storage
purposes.</p>

<p>The house is roomy and well-arranged, with a downstairs bedroom
and bathroom. By a slight change to make the second-floor like the
first, a bathroom or toilet could be arranged in the large closet by
the stairs. Storage space is provided in the attic.</p>

<p>All second-floor partitions are directly above those of the first
floor, thus making a strong, rigid house with the least framing
material.</p>

<h3><a id="VERY_SMALL"></a>VERY SMALL HOUSES</h3>

<p>The dimensions of the houses in the very-small-house group are
kept to the minimum by using the living rooms for sleeping rooms
at night. These houses cannot be considered adequate for the typical
farm family, but will serve for young married couples or for tenants
with small families.</p>


<h3>PLAN 6501<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 325 square feet. Stoop, 15 square feet.</div>

<p>In plan 6501, sleeping space is provided in double-deck beds
screened from the living room by draw curtains. If more space is
wanted later, a bedroom wing can be added at the end of the living
room. To save space, the kitchen is planned for an oil, gas, or
electric stove. With a house of this size, part of the housework would
have to be done outdoors, and a paved or graveled space under a
tree near the house would be a convenience.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6502<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 600 square feet. Stoop, 35 square feet.</div>

<p>The special feature of plan 6502 is the well-arranged kitchen, with
good storage space and a compact work area at one side of the direct
line of travel from the back door. Some privacy at night is afforded
by the double wardrobes and folding screen between the two beds in
the living room. The side porch will serve the double purpose of
workroom and sleeping porch. It should be screened and have curtains
to keep out the rain. By adding 4 feet to the living room and
an additional partition, a third room could be provided. A shower
bath may be installed in the large closet as shown.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6503<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span></h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, original house 520 square feet; with addition,
825 square feet.</div>

<p>Small homes are often cut up into several rooms, with the result
that in them a person has a "boxed-in" feeling. In plan 6503 the
rooms are few, and each is used for more than one purpose. If the
cost must be kept to a minimum, the bedroom and sleeping porch
may be omitted in the original construction. The kitchen-dining
room is unusually large for a house of this size, and the equipment is
grouped in the front part of the room where the housewife can have
a good view of the highway.</p>

<p>When the bedroom and sleeping porch are built, the bunk in the
kitchen-dining room may be taken out to provide more dining space;
or if one desires a cellar under part of the house, the cellar stairway
may replace the bunk space. A large window and high-beamed ceiling
are features of the living room. The chimney must not be too
small; it is a feature of the house.</p>

<h3>PLAN 6504,<span style="font-size:0.8em;"><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span> FOR THE SOUTHWEST</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 430 square feet. Porches, 145 square feet.</div>

<p>Plans 6504 and 6505 were designed for the central valleys of California,
where outdoor sleeping is invited, by the mild nights.</p>

<p>These were designed for temporary homes to be used later as shops,
bunk houses, storage buildings, or for other uses, so concrete floors
are recommended. Low-cost "frameless" construction is shown in
the working drawings. There are no ceilings. The shower baths
shown in the plans can be installed cheaply.</p>

<p>The kitchens and work porches are large enough for the needs of
a good-sized family. Plenty of windows are provided for ventilation.
The kitchen arrangement shows a wood-burning stove, and a
large refrigerator placed against an inside wall for protection from
the outdoor heat. It is expected that meals will ordinarily be eaten
in the kitchen or outdoors.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, 540 square feet. Porches, 60 square feet.</div>

<p>Though the rooms in plan 6506 have been kept as small as possible
in order to reduce cost, good use of space is realized in the arrangement.
Additions to the house would enable it to accommodate an
average-sized family.</p>

<p>A work-porch addition beside the kitchen and living room, between
the windows, would provide a place for laundry work and for
hanging outer wraps. A bathroom might be built by enclosing a
portion of the front porch and enlarging the window to make a doorway
from the hall. If desired, a third bedroom could be added at
the end of the living room.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, original house, 380 square feet; with first addition
600 square feet. Porches and entrances, 50 square feet. Cellar, first unit
380 square feet; with addition 600 square feet.</div>

<p>Plan 6507 is intended for snowy sections, and the first-floor is
purposely raised above the winter snow level. The house can be
built in either one or two stages.</p>

<p>No partition divides the kitchen and living room, which permits
heating the house with the kitchen range in mild weather. It also
aids ventilation in summer and facilitates serving of meals in the
living room.</p>

<p>The steps to the cellar are outside the house, protected by a storm
door. There is ample space in the cellar for laundry and storage.
A cistern under the kitchen provides soft water.</p>

<div class="blockquot">Floor areas: Superstructure, first stage 385 square feet; second stage 605
square feet; third stage 755 square feet. Porches and steps, first stage 20
square feet; second and third stages 70 square feet.</div>

<p>This house is designed for the minimum requirements of beginners
on the land, the first portion being 16 by 24 feet outside. It may
either be enlarged for a permanent dwelling or later used as a service
building. The bedroom is ample in size, but the living room, because
it must also be used temporarily as a kitchen and dining room, will
be crowded. This unit may be made 18 feet instead of 16 feet wide.
Later the kitchen and a small bedroom may be added at the rear of
the first unit, with a side porch off the kitchen. The door between
the kitchen and living room
will then be changed to the
right of the chimney, and a
narrow hall taken off the rear
of the front bedroom.</p>

<div class="fig_right" style="width: 259px;">

</div>

<p>If an additional bedroom is
desired, it can be added to the
left of the bathroom, making
the third stage for this house.
The closet in the kitchen
should be removed and a door
cut through to allow easy access
from the kitchen to the
bath and bedrooms. The bedroom
closets must be rearranged
to allow for these
changes.</p>

<p>Plans 6509 and 6510, for the South and the Middle West, respectively,
are low-cost houses for families that need only one bedroom.
The kitchens are well-arranged and have good storage space. Closet
space also is ample for houses of this size.</p>

<p>A storage and workroom, as shown in plan 6510, is a good feature
for the North but is not so much needed in the South, where mild
weather permits doing much housework outdoors. The living room
fireplace and kitchen range should heat house 6509 comfortably
under ordinary southern conditions, but in the North arrangements
should be made for a stove or circulator heater as in plan 6510.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
